# ChemChain

A blockchain-powered platform for chemical manufacturing that ensures transparency, traceability, and regulatory compliance in supply chains.

---

## Overview

ChemChain uses four smart contracts to create a decentralized, secure, and efficient ecosystem for chemical manufacturers, suppliers, and regulators:

1. **Batch Tracking Contract** – Tracks chemical batches from production to delivery.
2. **Compliance Verification Contract** – Ensures adherence to regulatory standards.
3. **Supply Chain Oracle Contract** – Integrates off-chain data for real-time updates.
4. **Token Incentive Contract** – Rewards participants for timely and compliant deliveries.

---

## Features

- **Batch traceability** with immutable records of production and distribution  
- **Regulatory compliance** through automated verification  
- **Real-time supply chain updates** via oracles  
- **Incentive rewards** for compliant and timely deliveries

## Smart Contracts

### Batch Tracking Contract
- Records batch details (origin, composition, timestamp)  
- Tracks movement through supply chain stages  
- Immutable audit trail for transparency  

### Compliance Verification Contract
- Verifies batches against regulatory standards (e.g., safety, quality)  
- Stores compliance certificates on-chain  
- Automated checks for regulatory adherence  

### Supply Chain Oracle Contract
- Fetches off-chain data (e.g., production logs, shipping status)  
- Provides real-time updates to batch tracking  
- Ensures data integrity with secure oracle integration  

### Token Incentive Contract
- Issues tokens to reward compliant suppliers  
- Manages token staking for supply chain participation  
- Distributes rewards based on performance metrics
